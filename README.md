You can now prefix all jekyll commands listed in this tutorial with ```bundle exec``` to make sure you use the jekyll version defined in your Gemfile.

## Commands

* ```bundle exec jekyll build```: Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called _site
* ```bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload```: Does jekyll build and runs it on a local web server at <http://localhost:4000>, rebuilding the site any time you make a change
